## Introduction

* WinArk is an open source Anti-Rootkit(ARK) tool for Windows, aimed at reverse engineering of kernel. It supports from Windows 7 to Windows 11. We also support both 32 bit and 64 bit. Compared with other Ark tools, WinArk can run on the latest Windows 11 without updating binary files since it will automatically downloads requisite symbol files.
